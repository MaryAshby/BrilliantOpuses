<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Searched for APIs with sufficient data. I bypassed, cats, Chuck Norris, Star Wars, and Pokemon for the New York Times (NYT).</li>
<li>I set up my developer account with NYT. They use special keys to track usage for each pull from their site. They also require
a logo to go on the site pulling their data.</li>
<li>I set up my general layout. Background image is from:  <a href = "flickr.com/photos/thadz/12213308404"> Background </a></li>
  <li>Added my search boxes and used the same CSS from the Classy Cats layout of the first project.</li>
  <li>Although I originally had grand plans of using all the information (Author, Publishers, Cost, Publication Date, etc. . . ) in 
    the possible search formats, I gave it up for the much smaller selection of Best Seller List, Best Seller Date, and Publish Date because
    of time and energy.</li>
  <li>Started out with a drop down menu for the Book Lists. Changed it to radio buttons because it was more obvious that you had to choose one.</li>
  <li>Made the mistake of looking in to php. That took a while. . . .</li>
  <li>NYT Key has been giving me hassle (saying it is not valid). I REALLY hope it works by the time you're looking at this.</li>
  <li>At midnight I remembered that I just had to meet the requirements of the assigment, not make it supercool. You had to know the exact date
    of the the publication to get a return (otherwise it said "internal error"). So I cut out the date requests so that the first inquiry
    only returned the list information.</li>
