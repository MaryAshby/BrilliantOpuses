<h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Searched for APIs with sufficient data. I bypassed, cats, Chuck Norris, Star Wars, and Pokemon for the New York Times (NYT).</li>
<li>I set up my developer account with NYT. They use special keys to track usage for each pull from their site. They also require
a logo to go on the site pulling their data.</li>
<li>I set up my general layout. Background image is from:  <a href = "flickr.com/photos/thadz/12213308404"> Background </a></li>
  <li>Added my search boxes and used the same CSS from the Classy Cats layout of the first project.</li>
  <li>Although I originally had grand plans of using all the information (Author, Publishers, Cost, Publication Date, etc. . . ) in 
    the possible search formats, I gave it up for the much smaller selection of Best Seller List, Best Seller Date, and Publish Date because
    of time and energy.</li>
